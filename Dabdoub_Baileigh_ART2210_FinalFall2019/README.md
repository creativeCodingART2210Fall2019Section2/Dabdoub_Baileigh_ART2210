Final Designer Statement
For my final, I decided to work off my “Shark Attack” game from the second project. I wanted to add a score keeper, clean up the shark a little, and add “blood” from the shark eating its victims. I also wanted to add pictures of the characters from the movies into the array displaying the victims. Unfortunately, I only accomplished two of these things. I was able to clean up the shark and add the “blood” by using an array and utilizing the push and splice functions. For some reason, even though I uploaded the photos as an array and added them to my constructor function, it still gave me an error message every time I ran it. I left the null code in my coding document if you wanted to look at it and see if maybe you can see where I went wrong. As for the scoring, I wanted it to be how many people you ate in a time limit. I know that coding a score keeper should've been easy, but I just could not figure it out. The adding of the “blood” honestly took me forever, but I did get it to work, and it looks good! So, I am very proud of that. I will probably continue to work on this when this class ends so I can perfect the game! I definitely want to learn more and become more fluent in the coding language, so that I am able to easily code simple pictures and games whenever I want. These skills will definitely be utilized in my chosen field of work, graphic design. It is also a skill that many other candidates may not possess when a company is hiring, so that will also give me an edge.
