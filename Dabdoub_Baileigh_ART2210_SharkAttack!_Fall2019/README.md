Game Project Artist Statement
	I created the game called “Shark Attack.” I wanted to use the arrays and constructor functions to be able to click the circle (people) and make them go away (get eaten). I had originally planned to make it more realistic and even add in pictures of peoples faces as the people swimming in the water. I also wanted to add blood, but I couldn't get it to add in alone with making the circle go away when clicking on them, and that was most important. 
	I was inspired by the movie Jaws, if that isn't obvious. I almost wanted to add more theme factors of Jaws into the code as well, and if I had more time to figure it out I would have. I may even go back and add it just for fun. When I started, I was pretty confused on constructor functions and how to use arrays within them, but now I think I have a much firmer grasp on the concept. I’m finding that the only way to really learn it is to do it wrong a million times or until you finally do it right. 
	I enjoyed this project, even though it was a little out of my element. I told my friend who designs games for fun about the project and he asked what game ware I was using. Obviously, we did not use any so I felt pretty good that he was impressed that I did use anything and still had a pretty good outcome.
