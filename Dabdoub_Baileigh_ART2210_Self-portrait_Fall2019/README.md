##Artist Statement
	
	I had a hard time figuring out where I wanted to go with this project, but I did know I wanted to feature my green eyes. At first, I wanted to use pointillism as my inspiration, and I did get pretty far into the project doing that. Then, I saw one of Piet Mondrian’s works online, and I just knew that would be perfect. So, I basically started over. I was really inspired by his simple shapes and simple use of color. Even though I introduced new shapes and colors to his original work, I think I stay pretty true to his idea.
	Although it was a static picture, I decided to add a little more to it. When you move the mouse over the left eye, it'll wink at you. I though that since the work is a simpler design, like much of Mondrian’s works, it would be worth it to take a little extra time to add a little flair. I wanted to add a drawing feature for the hair, but I though that strayed a little too far from the original inspiration for the design. I did experience a little trouble getting through the assignment. I got stuck plenty of times, but I think it came out pretty good in the end when it was completed. 
	This project has left me eager to learn more and excited of the next one. I have learned a lot not only from what we have learned in class, but also from what I have had to troubleshoot for myself. Although, this project, and this class in general, was a little challenging, I believe the knowledge I have gained and am still gaining will definitely be worth it in the end. This is especially true when it comes to my career.
